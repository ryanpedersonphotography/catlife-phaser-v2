## Key Differences from Modern Version

### What Was Preserved:
- All 9 original cats with exact names and traits
- 4-room house layout
- Energy and scoring systems
- Conflict mechanics
- Special behaviors and mess creation
- Door control system
- Challenge/Endless game modes

### What Was Ignored:
- Text-based command line interface
- Terminal-specific code
- Console-based interactions
- ASCII art elements

## Debug Features

The original game includes debug helpers accessible via `window.originalGame`:
- `getCats()` - View all cat states
- `getRooms()` - View room information  
- `getEnergy()` - Check current energy
- `getScore()` - Check current score
- `toggleDoor()` - Toggle door open/closed

## Next Steps

The original game is now fully functional and preserves all the unique characteristics that made the original CatLife special. Players can experience the exact same cat personalities, conflicts, and behaviors in a modern Phaser.js interface while maintaining the challenging energy management and scoring systems of the original design.
