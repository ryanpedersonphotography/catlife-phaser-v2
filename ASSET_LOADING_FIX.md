# Asset Loading Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
The Cat Life Phaser game was hanging during asset loading because the PreloadScene was attempting to load assets that didn't exist as files:

- `food_bowl_full.png` (404 Not Found)
- `litter_box_dirty.png` (404 Not Found)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **File Loading Attempt**: The `loadRealAssets()` method in PreloadScene.js was trying to load these assets as files using `this.load.image()`
2. **Missing Files**: These assets don't exist in the `/assets/sprites/` directory
3. **Unused Generation Code**: The PreloadScene had a `generateGameObjects()` method that could create these textures programmatically, but it wasn't being called
4. **Incomplete Asset Generation**: The `generateMissingAssets()` method didn't include the `generateGameObjects()` call

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed File Loading**: Removed the `this.load.image()` calls for `food_bowl_full` and `litter_box_dirty` from `loadRealAssets()`
2. **Added Generation Call**: Added `this.generateGameObjects()` call to the `generateMissingAssets()` method
3. **Fixed Load Order**: Assets are now generated during the preload process instead of being loaded as files

## Files Modified
- `/src/scenes/PreloadScene.js`:
  - Lines 70-72: Removed file loading for non-existent assets
  - Line 398: Added `this.generateGameObjects()` call to generate missing textures

## Result
The game should now load successfully because:
- Only existing files are loaded via HTTP requests
- Missing textures are generated programmatically during preload
- No more 404 errors that cause the loader to hang

## Testing
The fix can be verified by:
1. Checking that the game loads past the loading screen
2. Verifying that `food_bowl_full` and `litter_box_dirty` textures exist in the game
3. Confirming no console errors related to missing assets

## Assets Now Available
After the fix, these textures are generated dynamically:
- `food_bowl_full` - Food bowl with kibble
- `litter_box_dirty` - Litter box with waste particles
- Various UI elements, particles, and toy sprites
