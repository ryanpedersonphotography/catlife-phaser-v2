# Cat Life Phaser v2 - Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Complete Phaser Rebuild

### Initial Implementation
- Created new project structure with Webpack and modern JavaScript
- Implemented scene-based architecture (Boot, Preload, MainMenu, Game, UI)
- Built comprehensive data models (CatDatabase, RoomLayout, Constants)
- Created prefab classes for all game objects (Cat, Room, FoodBowl, LitterBox)
- Implemented save/load system with localStorage
- Added day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Created AI behavior system for cats

### Asset Generation System
- Built procedural sprite generation for all game assets
- Implemented 8-frame sprite sheets for cat animations
- Created room backgrounds, UI elements, and particles programmatically
- Added SVG to PNG conversion pipeline using ImageMagick
- Generated unique sprites for all 20 cats with proper colors

### Major Bug Fixes

#### Loading Screen Hang (Fixed)
**Problem**: Game hung at "Loading assets..." screen
**Cause**: Texture generation methods called during preload phase instead of create phase
**Solution**: 
- Moved generateRoomBackgrounds() and generateMissingAssets() to create phase
- Fixed asset loading sequence
- Added proper error handling for missing assets

#### Special Needs Undefined Error (Fixed)
**Problem**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'medication')"
**Cause**: Only Tink has specialNeeds property, but code didn't check for existence
**Solution**: Added null checks in 4 locations:
- Cat.js checkSpecialConditions()
- NeedManager.js getSpecialNeeds()
- GameState.js saveCat()
- UIScene.js showCatInfo()

#### Cat Sprites Not Visible (Fixed)
**Problem**: Cats existed in game but weren't visible on screen
**Cause**: Multiple issues with sprite generation and rendering
**Solution**:
- Fixed sprite sheet frame generation
- Added colored circle fallback for each cat
- Corrected texture key mapping
- Ensured sprites are set to visible with proper alpha

### Technical Improvements
- Optimized sprite generation to use single canvas per cat
- Improved error logging and debugging capabilities
- Added comprehensive console logging for asset loading
- Created test utilities for sprite verification
- Enhanced Cat prefab with better visibility debugging

### Current State
- Game loads successfully without hanging
- All 20 cats are visible (as colored circles or sprites)
- No runtime errors during normal gameplay
- Save/load system functional
- All core features implemented

### Known Limitations
- Cat sprites may show as colored circles if detailed sprites fail to generate
- Performance not yet optimized for 20 simultaneous cats
- Some visual polish needed for generated sprites
